## <a name="introduction">ðŸ¤– Introduction</a>

Built with Next.js, **Psy-Fi** is an app that uses self-reported emotion to predict and manage purchasing behavior. By combining *mood diary* and customerâ€™s *purchasing history*, Psy-Fi enables users to gain behavioral awareness and receive tailored financial suggestions from personal AI assistants. The appâ€™s goal is to prevent emotional spending while promoting mindful financial decisions.  

## <a name="features">ðŸ”‹ Features</a>

ðŸ‘‰ **Mood Diary**: Users rate their mood on a [mood meter](https://hopelab.org/case-study/mood-meter/) (developed by Yale's *HOPE* Lab) to accurately identify, regulate, and take responsibility to their mood. 

ðŸ‘‰ **Valence-Arousal Plot**: To quantify those mood, we further decompose those mood into valence and arousal dimensions based on work of Dr. Mohammad, Saif. (2018) [Paper](https://aclanthology.org/P18-1017/) | [Dataset](https://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/nrc-vad.html)

ðŸ‘‰ **Mood-Spend Analysis**: We read the purchasing history from usersâ€™ credit cards directly and then correlate the spending patterns with mood (valence & Arousal) fluctuations

ðŸ‘‰ **AI Assistant: Penny**: Whenver user logs new emotions, Penny analyze it and identify the emotion trends to flag potential risky purchasing moments and give proactive alert/suggestion. 

ðŸ‘‰ **Social Comparison**: Penny will also compare your emotion spending against anonymized data from similar demographics and give more informed suggestions.
